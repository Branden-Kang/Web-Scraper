Laptops and tablets\\xa0sure are portable and convenient, but when you\\'re spending nearly your whole day on the computer it can be better to have a big-screen monitor -- or even a multiple-monitor setup.\\nThe best feature of desktop PCs is the durability and longevity they provide. Not only are desktops built more solidly, but not moving around much contributes to far less wear and tear than your conventional laptop will see. And another of the best desktop PC features is that you can get a decent bit more power and expandability than you could from a laptop, along with a powerful processor and a higher quality hard drive or solid-state drive for storage. That processor power and drive potential are particularly crucial if you\\'re planning to use your personal computer as a gaming PC or a graphics-editing powerhouse.\\nA desktop computer is generally going to come in the form of either a tower or an all-in-one (with an integrated screen), though there are smaller designs for tighter spaces. And while you can find Windows and\\xa0Macs\\xa0for as little as $500 to $700, Chrome and Linux fans have plenty of affordable options, too.\\nWhile laptops still occupy the majority of our editors\\' time and effort with CNET\\'s hands-on reviews, we\\'ve rounded up recent products to bring you the very best desktop PC options, which are listed below. This list starts with models we\\'ve tested, and then moves on to more generic configurations. We haven\\'t explicitly tested those specific models in the latter batch, but the specs listed should deliver considerable value for the price, based on our experience with similarly configured laptops we\\'ve tested. Unless otherwise indicated, the products listed below don\\'t include a\\xa0monitor,\\xa0keyboard,\\xa0mouse\\xa0or\\xa0webcam. You\\'ll need to bring your own or buy them separately. We update this best desktop PC list periodically.\\nThese are the best desktop PC models that we\\'ve recently tested and can recommend based on our hands-on experience.\\nApple has fully redesigned the iMac with a body so ultrathin that it could easily be confused with a jumbo-screen iPad. It\\'s now built on the same superfast M1 chip found in Apple\\'s late-2020 MacBook Air and Mac Mini (see below), with a gorgeous 24-inch screen replacing the previous 21.5-inch version. The 1080p webcam is a big upgrade over the MacBook\\'s 720p model, and the rainbow of available colors -- hearkening back to the 1999 iMac G3 -- is a welcome addition. Just be prepared to spend up for the myriad storage and accessory upgrades. (Note that the larger 27-inch iMac has been discontinued as of March 2022.)\\nRead our 2021 Apple iMac review.\\n\\nWhile we like all-in-ones for their convenience, they\\'re not easy to upgrade, if they can be at all. Dell\\'s XPS Desktop is compact and quiet enough for a small workspace but can be loaded with a 12th-gen Core i9 processor, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card, up to 64GB of memory and 4TB of storage -- and there\\'s still room inside for more. And if you have modest needs now, but want the room to add in components down the road, the base XPS starts at under $800. However, if you do plan to upgrade down the road, spend a little extra for its 750- or 1,000-watt power supply. Want to spend a bit less? Check out the more affordable desktop computer options recommended further down the page.\\nRead our Dell XPS Desktop 8950 review.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for the most affordable Mac out there, the news is good nearly all around. Apple\\'s smallest desktop computer was among the first to get upgraded to the lightning-fast M1 processor, which runs rings around comparable Intel-powered Macs in terms of speed and performance. Unlike MacBook laptops, the Mini boasts legacy ports like USB-A and HDMI, too. The 256GB and 512GB models will run you $699 and $899, respectively, at the Apple Store, but the good news is that they\\'re now frequently on sale at other retailers for $50 to $100 less. More and more Mac apps are\\xa0adding compatibility for the M1 platform, and Apple\\'s Rosetta 2 software runs most legacy apps in a fairly speedy compatibility mode, but if you still want native Intel support, a Core i5 version of the Mini remains in the line for $1,099. Need more power? Check out the Mac Studio.\\nRead our hands-on experience with the 2020 M1 Mac lineup.\\n\\nCompact all-in-one desktops make good centralized family computers. The HP Chromebase takes it a step further by pairing one with the simple and secure Chrome OS -- the same operating system found on the Chromebooks your kids are probably using at school. With a 21.5-inch touchscreen attached to a gray fabric-covered base, the desktop looks like a supersized version of Google\\'s own\\xa0Nest Hub smart display\\xa0(and with Google Assistant baked in, you can use it like one, too). Inside, though, is up to an Intel Core i3-10110U processor, up to 16GB of memory and up to a 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD. The full-HD display even rotates vertically, perfect for viewing vertical videos, following recipes or scrolling your favorite sites.\\nRead our HP Chromebase AiO 22 review.\\n\\nThe Mac Pro has long been the top dog in Apple\\'s computer lineup, but the current version is an aging Intel model that starts at a whopping $5,000. By comparison, the new-for-2022 Mac Studio is powered by the latest, greatest Apple silicon chips -- the M1 Max or M1 Ultra -- and starts at less than half that price. It\\'s basically a Mac Mini on steroids, and -- for anyone who doesn\\'t want to wait for the eventual Mac Pro revision -- it\\'s your best bet for running creative-centric Mac apps, including animation, graphics, video-editing and audio-editing software. Read our Mac Studio review.\\nWe haven\\'t reviewed the specific models below, but we have reviewed systems using very similar hardware. These general configurations should serve you well, especially if you shop around for frequent deals.\\nThe specs we\\'d suggest for a basic Windows 10 or Windows 11 machine:\\nWith those specs in mind, you should be able to find a good PC tower from brands like Dell, Acer, Asus or HP for between $500 and $600. Here are some that fit the bill, offering a great bang for the buck if you don\\'t need a laptop:\\nAcer Aspire TC-895-UA92 (under $630)\\nAside from a slightly older 10th-gen Intel Core i5 CPU, this configuration otherwise includes everything listed above, along with Wi-Fi 6 compatibility and a keyboard and mouse, too.\\nHP Pavilion Desktop TP01-2040 (under $650)\\nThis system offers a capable AMD Ryzen 5 CPU, and HP throws in a mouse and keyboard.\\nWant to do some PC gaming, or do you spend time editing photos or video? You\\'ll want to level up the preceding configuration with more RAM and better graphics options. Expect price points to be between $800 and $1,200 -- and even higher if you go for a more bleeding-edge video card.\\nLooking for a gaming computer with more muscle? Check out our list of best gaming PCs.\\nHP Pavilion Gaming Desktop (under $1,000)\\nThis HP rig boasts an 11th-generation and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 GPU and 16GB of RAM.\\nAn \"all-in-one PC\" (also known as AIO PC) is basically a Windows version of an iMac. That means the PC \"guts\" are essentially built into a monitor or its base. Unlike the PC towers listed above, all-in-ones generally offer no ability to upgrade the graphics card, and maybe not even the storage or RAM. The advantage is having fewer cables, however, since everything is integrated into the body.\\nRecommended specs for an all-in-one are mostly similar to the basic tower above, albeit with compromises because of space considerations. Don\\'t expect an optical drive, for instance, and know that performance is often a step down from \"real\" desktop models because some all-in-ones use laptop components to better maximize available space. You\\'ll want a large screen with good resolution. The sweet spots we\\'d suggest are:\\nThe 24-inchers are good for kids, but adults should probably go for 27 inches and up. Expect to pay at least $800 at that latter size, especially if you want to avoid underpowered Intel Core i3 or AMD Athlon CPUs. The HP Envy 32/34 and Apple iMacs are examples of high end all-in-one computers, but here\\'s a more reasonably priced alternative.\\nAcer Aspire C27-962-UA91 ($999)\\nWhile the screen on this Acer Aspire model is a spacious 27 inches, resolution is only 1080p (also known as 2K) -- but that\\'s par for the course below the $1,000 price point. This model also lacks a DVD drive and USB-C ports. That said, you get a 10th-gen Intel Core i5 CPU, on-board Nvidia MX graphics (not as good as a GTX or RTX card, but better than average), half a terabyte of SSD storage and a built-in webcam (along with a keyboard and mouse).\\nHP All-in-ones (recommended models starting at $800)\\nBack in early 2020, we reviewed the HP Envy 32, a Windows take on the basic iMac design. At that time, it had somewhat dated specs: a ninth-gen Intel CPU and a spinning hard drive backing up the 256GB solid-state drive. The 32-inch model appears to have been discontinued, but HP maintains a stable of current models in 22- to 27-inch screen sizes, with a new $2,000 34-inch HP Envy 34 now living at the top of the line.\\nWhile you\\'re paying a big premium for the Apple name, an iMac is generally a great option for Apple fans who want an all-in-one computer with a superior display. And now that the 24-inch iMac has gotten a nice overhaul, complete with the M1 chip, that\\'s a great starting point. And while the 27-inch iMac is no more, the new Mac Studio starts at $2,000, and offers some serious power, especially if you ramp up to the M1 Ultra chipset.\\nNeed even more power? While Apple has a Mac Pro living at the top of its desktop line, the current model is an aging Intel design, which the company has already pledged to replace with an Apple Silicon version. If the Mac Studio can\\'t handle your high-end Apple needs, we\\'d strongly recommend steering clear of the Mac Pro until that new version hits.\\nWhen it comes to desktop PCs, towers and all-in-ones represent the vast majority of the market. There are alternatives, but in the 2020s, they generally represent increasingly narrow slices of that market.\\nLeft to right: The HP Mini, Acer Revo, Intel Compute Stick and Apple Mac Mini. The Mac is the only one that\\'s been recently updated.\\nMini PCs: Following the debut of the Mac Mini in 2005, Windows PC makers experimented with similarly tiny designs. In the wake of likable small models like the Acer Revo One and HP Pavilion Mini, we even saw (woefully underpowered) \"PC on a stick\" offerings starting in 2015, but interest seems to have ebbed since then. Outside of specialty vendors like Beelink, the best choices in this mini PC size are probably the Intel NUC (Next Unit of Computing), most of which are sold as hobbyist options, requiring some BYO additions like user-supplied storage, RAM and other components -- including the operating system. See more bare-bones Mini PCs at Newegg.\\nChromeboxes: If you\\'re looking for very basic computing -- browsing the web, email, social media, YouTube and the like -- the Chrome operating system is the most affordable route for home computing. This Google operating system effectively is little more than the Chrome web browser. That makes it easy for multiple users (only a Gmail address is needed to log in), and -- because there\\'s no heavy operating system beyond the browser -- viruses aren\\'t really an issue. Colloquially known as \"Chromeboxes\" (versus a \"Chromebook\" laptop), these systems don\\'t have beefy CPUs, RAM or storage requirements. That said, if you need any software beyond browser-based web apps, or if you don\\'t have excellent broadband, you\\'ll want to stick with Windows or Mac options above. Now, before you spend any money, you should check out the free version of the operating system known as\\xa0ChromeOS Flex, which you can install on most old PCs (including running it from an attached USB drive). But if that\\'s not an option and you want to buy new, expect to pay between $200 and $500 for a Chrome-based desktop. However, the closer you get to that $500 price point, the more you should consider stepping up to a Chromebook laptop or a basic Windows tower (see above) for just a bit more. See Chromebox options at Newegg.\\nLinux PCs: No, Windows, Mac and ChromeOS are not your only operating system options. There\\'s a wide world of Linux operating systems out there, many of which are effectively free. You can get PCs with Linux preinstalled, but the better, more affordable option is probably installing it (or dual-booting) on a used Windows PC. See Linux PC options at Newegg.\\nRaspberry Pi: You may have heard of a small computer that\\'s no bigger than a paperback book, and can be had for about $150. That\\'s the Raspberry Pi, and it\\'s 100% real and very cool -- if you\\'re a hobbyist looking to build your own Lego-style computer and install your own custom Linux operating systems. We just wouldn\\'t recommend it as a primary computer if you\\'re looking to run mainstream software. See the Raspberry Pi 4 kit at Amazon.'),\n",

Thankfully, you don't have to worry about keeping track of each and every update that's released because Windows 11 is set to automatically download and install updates by default. However, the automatic updates can sometimes come at inopportune moments, and sometimes you may want to hold off if the update doesn't include a patch for a security vulnerability.\\nMost updates shouldn't negatively affect your device, but some may be buggy, causing problems with a certain app or function you use regularly. In cases like this, it can be better to wait for a fix to any issues a particular update may have caused. In addition, restarts and update installations can sometimes take hours, depending on your connection speed and the size of the update.\\nIf you want to have more control over your Windows 11 updates, there are things you can do like pause updates for a set amount of time, restrict automatic updates from completing at certain times of the day, check for updates manually or disable automatic updates entirely.\\nIt's worth reiterating that updates with important security patches should be applied immediately to protect your device. But if you want more control over nonessential updates, here's how to manage automatic updates for Windows 11.\\nYou can pause automatic updates from happening for a set amount of time -- anywhere from one to five weeks.\\n1.\\xa0Go to Settings\\n2. Click on Windows Update\\n3. Under More options, click the Pause updates dropdown to select the amount of time you'd like to pause your automatic updates\\nIf you want to resume automatic updates at any time prior to the end of your selected time period, you can click the Resume updates button in the same Windows Update menu.\\nNote that you can't pause updates indefinitely: Once the pause time has lapsed, you'll need to install the latest updates before you can use the pause feature again.\\nIf you'd rather disable automatic updates for an indefinite period of time, you can do so through Windows Services if you don't mind getting a little technical.\\n1.\\xa0Launch the\\xa0Run\\xa0window by hitting the\\xa0Windows button + R\\n2.

These built-in tricks can help you do everything from setting up Taskbar shortcuts to saving battery power.\\nMicrosoft isn't typically as upfront about its hidden features in the same way that Apple tends to be, which can sometimes make it more difficult to know how to take advantage of all that Windows has to offer. But we've got you covered here with our list of hidden features you can start using right now to get the most out of Windows 11.\\nNo matter which Microsoft, Dell, HP or other Windows compatible rig you have, these clever tips will help you stay organized and get more done. Plus, here's everything you need to know about Windows 11, the best features in Windows 11 and how it compares to Windows 10.\\nIf your desktop screen has gotten too crowded with open windows, you can quickly minimize them all except the one you are currently working in. You'll need to turn this on in Windows 11 by heading to Settings, then System, then Multitasking and turning on Title bar window shake\\nJust click the title bar of the window you want to remain open to select it. Then, hold the mouse down and move the window back and forth quickly -- shaking it, essentially. After a couple of quick shakes, all other open windows will minimize, leaving only the one you've shaken open. Neat, huh?\\nYou know that to get to the Start menu, you hit the Windows icon in the bottom lefthand corner of the screen or on your keyboard, but Windows 11 includes a lesser-known second Start menu. This menu makes accessing important features like the Command Prompt, the Control Panel and the Task Manager much easier. You can access it two different ways, either by pressing the Windows key + X, or right click the Windows icon/Start button.\\nIt's a basic one, but it's amazing how easy it is to forget how to take a screenshot on your laptop or desktop when you don't do it often.\\nThere are at least seven different ways you can take a screenshot with Windows. If you want to capture and save a picture of your entire screen, the easiest way is to hit the Windows key + Print Screen key, and that picture will be saved to the Pictures > Screenshots folder.\\nRead more:\\xa0Need a Productivity Boost? Give These Windows 11 Multitasking Features a Try\\nTo capture just one part of your screen, hit the Windows key + Shift + S to open a tool called Snip & Sketch, which allows you to click and drag to create a screenshot, which is saved to your Clipboard.\\nIf you've pinned programs to your Taskbar at the bottom of your screen to create a shortcut, you don't have to click the icons to open them. Instead, use the keyboard shortcut Windows key + [Number key], with the number key corresponding to the position of the pinned program on the Taskbar. For example, Windows key + 2 will open the second pinned item on the Taskbar.\\nThis is especially useful if you're typing furiously and don't want to lift your fingers from the keyboard. It may feel more natural to reach for the Windows key.\\nComputers start running slower as they grow short on space. One quick way to speed them up may be to get rid of apps that take up more space than they should, especially if you don't regularly use them.\\nTo see how much space apps, temporary files and documents are taking up, navigate to Settings > System > Storage. Tap Show more categories to see a full list.\\nTo get an idea of what to toss, tap Cleanup recommendations to see what Windows 11 suggests. You probably won't get rid of your browser, but you might find that a game you haven't played in years is some good dead weight to drop.\\nApps that run in the background can receive info, send notifications and stay updated, even when you aren't using them. This can be useful, but it can also suck your battery and your data.\\nTo control which apps are running in the background and save some battery power and data, go to Settings > System > Power & battery. Tap Battery saver and then adjust when battery saver turns on to limit some notifications and background activity.\\nWith Windows 11, you can scroll up and down on any window -- even if it's not the one you're directly working in. This is a useful tool when you have a lot of windows open that you want to look through at the same time -- for example, if you want to open new sub-menu options in new windows to save you time clicking back and forward on the same page.\\nTry opening two programs -- say, an internet browser page and a notepad or Word document. Arrange both on the screen so you can see at least some of the text on each. While you are in one window, hover your mouse or use the touchpad to move to the second window, and scroll. Even though you aren't active in that window, it should allow you to move up and down the page.\\nThe feature should be on by default, but if it isn't, go to Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Mouse, and toggle Scroll inactive windows when I hover over them to On. Then you can place your mouse over a window that's in the background and use the scroll wheel to scroll.\\nMicrosoft hides file extensions by default, which makes life difficult for people who need to look for specific types of files, like JPEGs and JPGs. To see file extensions in File Explorer, do the following:\\n1. Using Search in the task bar, and type File Explorer Options, and click it. (There are other ways to get here too, such as using search in the Start menu, but this method works fine.)\\n2. In the window that pops up, click the View tab.\\n3. If it's checked, uncheck the box that says Hide extensions for known file types. Click Apply, and OK. You should now see file extensions for all files in the File Explorer.\\nYou can also use the File Explorer Options menu to choose to show empty drives, hidden files and folders, and more.\\nIt's frustrating to try and get work done when you keep getting interrupted with notifications. You can determine how many you get with Focus assist.\\nSet it up by going to Settings > System > Focus assist. Choose from three options: Off (get all notifications from your apps and contacts), Priority only (see only selected notifications from a priority list that you customize, and send the rest to your action center), and Alarms only (hide all notifications, except for alarms).\\nYou can also choose to automatically turn this feature on during certain hours, when you're playing a game or when you're using an app in full-screen mode, for example.\\nFor more Windows 11 laptop tips and tricks, check out how you can help maximize your computer's battery life.\\n\"),\n",

              "  \"Sony launches its first PC gaming monitor as part of its debut of the InZone line of PC and PS5 compatible accessories -- and its first general-purpose monitor in decades. Sony primarily targets FPS fans with the 27-inch M9, which kind of does the monitor a disservice. With DisplayHDR 600 certification and a 96-zone local dimming array backlight, 4K resolution at up to 144Hz and HDMI 2.1 with VRR connectivity for consoles, it's really suited to the bulk of gaming genres. Maybe not to all pocketbooks, though.\\nThe InZone M9 (SDM-U27M90) is slated to ship this summer for $900 and will be followed by the M3 (SDM-F27M30) by the end of the year for $530. The M3 will have a 1080p 240Hz screen with a limited sRGB gamut and minimal HDR in the form of DisplayHDR 400.\\nPhysically, the monitor uses similar materials as the PS5, albeit forgoing the PS5's organic design in favor of a more angular aesthetic common to PC gaming displays. The rear legs of the stand don't look substantial, though they seem to be. Though it might look different from the pack, ultimately the monitor's setup and operation is the same as everyone else's.\\nThe monitor is expensive but not outrageous for its features and performance. In addition to the dual HDMI 2.1 connections, it also supports USB-C for display. It's got speakers, though they're not sufficient for gaming.\\nIt does have a striking profile.\\nI wish Sony had decided to break a little with tradition and use a better layout for the connections and cable management. Like many, the connections sit under a ridge on the rear, set back far enough that you've got to go through some contortions if you're trying to plug something in blindly -- which you'll be doing, because that's where the three USB-A connectors live. And one of the two HDMI 2.1 connectors is almost impossible to reach because it's mostly blocked by the stand.\\nIt has a tiny plastic hook that can hang off one of the thin legs through which you're supposed to feed your cables. It's not large enough to accommodate a few thick ones though, and really feels insubstantial.\\nThe onscreen display annoyingly defaults to one of the least-needed menu entries -- DDC on/off, and a level down -- which makes navigating a chore if you have to do it a lot.\\nThe connections are in the usual, inconvenient place.\\nIt has a built-in KVM switch, which means the USB ports depend upon the active input. That's a perk if you're connecting to two different systems or a PC and a console. The input scanning looking for an active connection seems to take a little longer than normal, though, and I got some unexpected resets (where it decides to recheck its connection) -- such as between benchmark tests -- that I've never seen with other monitors.\\nThe monitor does shine in many ways. Sony really, really expects you to stick to HDR. In a change from the norm, it's calibrated in HDR, but not SDR, which is good if you plan to use that mode a lot. And oddly, the default SDR setting is with local dimming turned on and set to high. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but may result in some unexpected behavior in places where you're expecting uniform brightness and contrast. It also changes with the presets -- high, low and off -- along with brightness.\\nAccuracy isn't bad in SDR, but it takes a little tweaking to get it within tolerances; dropping the green and blue channels to 95% did the trick as a quick-and-dirty solution.\\nIt does work best in HDR, where it hits its maximum gamut and expected white point. The tone curve gets thrown a bit because it doesn't seem to have the maximum brightness controlled well; I got readings as high as about 800 nits, but I think the system's assuming it won't hit that high.\\nI kind of miss having HDR presets to choose from, though. In Windows your choices are on or off. On the PS5, it supports Auto HDR and Auto Genre picture mode. The latter means that it changes to a game-optimized, low-latency mode when you launch a game and to a cinema-optimized mode when it detects a movie playing. Once again, though, all auto.\\nThe InZone M9 isn't my favorite all-around monitor, but thanks to the HDR performance and VRR support, it's still a top choice for dual-system gamers looking for a great picture and flexibility.\\nAll measurements are performed using Portrait Display's Calman Ultimate 2021 R4 software using a Calibrite ColorChecker Display Plus\\xa0(formerly X-Rite i1Display Pro Plus) and a Murideo Six-G\\xa0pattern generator for HDR testing where necessary, or the Client3 HDR patterns within Calman, where possible. How extensive our testing is depends on the capabilities of the monitor, the screen and backlight technology used, and the judgment of the reviewer.\\nOn the most basic models we may stick with just brightness, contrast and color gamut, while on more capable displays we may run tests of most user-selectable modes for gaming or color-critical usage, uniformity and so on. For the color work, we may also run tests to verify how white point accuracy varies with brightness.\\nColor accuracy results reported in units of Delta E 2000 are based on Calman's standard Pantone patch set, plus the grayscale and skin tone patches. White points results are based on both the actual white value plus the correlated color temperature for the entire gray scale (21 patches, 0 to 100%) rounded down to the nearest 50K as long as there are no big variations. We also use Blur Busters' motion tests to judge motion artifacts (such as ghosting) or refresh rate-related problems that can affect gaming.\"),\n",

Mojo Vision\\'s smart contact lenses, which have been in development for years, are finally being worn internally, starting with the company\\'s CEO Drew Perkins.\\nPerkins, who I spoke to over Zoom, has only worn the lens for an hour at a time so far. He likens the first tests to a baby learning to walk: \"We\\'ve now taken that first step. And it\\'s very exciting.\"\\nPerkins tested a few of the Mojo Lens app demos I tried with the lens on a stick earlier this year, reading text off a teleprompter app that put tiny text floating in a display in front of his eye, and looking at an image of Albert Einstein in green monochrome, which Perkins said \"looked great.\" He also demoed the lens\\' compass app that I tried, which used a built-in magnetometer to show compass readouts in real time. \"I was able to spin around 360 degrees and see it [go] from north, to northeast, to east, to southeast,\" he said. \"It was very cool.\"\\nMojo Vision\\'s hardware for the lens requires a neck-worn processor that wirelessly relays information to the lens and back to computers that track the eye movement data for research. For the moment, the setup also requires a special cap with an antenna built in that Perkins is wearing to ensure a smooth connection for early testing.\\nThe lenses have a tiny MicroLED display onboard, a short-range custom wireless radio, a tiny ARM processor and motion tracking in the form of an accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. It\\'s the same lens hardware I looked at off-eye back in the spring of this year. The lenses enable eye-controlled head-up displays to appear to hover in-air, approaching a type of monochromatic Google Glass-like AR interface without glasses.\\nThe company\\'s only doing tests with one lens in one eye for the moment, although the next goal is to have two lenses worn at once for 3D visual overlays. After Perkins, who\\'s still just wearing the lens intermittently for about an hour at a time for testing, other executives at the company will be trying the hardware. Perkins says these early stages are just trying to get the hardware on its feet: \"We spent lots of time just validating and calibrating the radio, to make sure the radio is working,\" he says. \"We\\'re not doing extended-time testing yet. We\\'ll get there.\"\\n\"With this advancement, we now have a testing platform that helps us refine and build Mojo Lens that will ultimately lead to submission to the FDA for market approval,\" Perkins adds in a statement about the milestone. \"To accomplish this, we will conduct several clinical studies to test capabilities and provide feedback on software and apps.\"\\nBy the end of this year, Mojo Vision\\'s goal is to test the lens out beyond company executives, to partners such as those interested in exploring fitness and health training possibilities, or investors or journalists. I admit I feel pretty nervous about the idea of putting a lens filled with processors into my eye: the deepest I\\'ve ever worn tech is earbuds in my ears.\\nBut based on how Perkins describes the state of smart contact lenses, they\\'re still extremely early in a prototype phase that\\'s only now just getting to a first-step wearable form. Where they go next will certainly take time, and it\\'s unclear how quickly that process will move. I know I\\'ve been amazed by just looking through a lens held a few millimeters from my eye, but actually wearing one is a whole other leap forward.'),\n",

In the meantime, you could fill the gap with a cloud-gaming service (such as Stadia or GeForce Now) or a desktop-as-a-service like Shadow -- provided your network connection is up to it.\\nI\\'ll admit, I\\'m waving my hands a bit here: Some of these aren\\'t recommendations for a specific gaming computer, more for ballpark configurations and honorable mentions of the manufacturers or system builders with a specific case design that you should consider in various scenarios if you\\'re a PC gamer. (And when it\\'s time to sweat the details,\\xa0User Benchmark\\xa0is a great site for getting a sense of key features and performance deltas between different components.)\\nAs far as PC gaming goes, all power players ponder\\xa0how to build a gaming PC at some point or another. As they go through the gaming PC build, they also wonder whether the resulting gaming experience is worth it. Doing your own PC build is a great option if choices and DIY don\\'t scare you -- it\\'s sometimes the only way to get the best gaming PC configuration for your needs -- or if you think PC building will be fun. But it generally doesn\\'t work out to be a way to save money over an identical prebuilt gaming PC, or if you don\\'t know what a motherboard is and how it works.\\nIt may be cheaper to do your own PC build than getting a premium custom PC model from a company like Origin PC, Falcon Northwest, Digital Storm, Maingear and the like, but the flip side is that it\\'s nice to have someone else do the overclocking iterations, stability testing and burn-in runs. There are few things more frustrating than gearing up and sitting down to play the latest AAA only to have it crap out during the opening cutscene with only yourself to blame.\\nThe other high-level decision you may confront is whether to go with a gaming desktop or laptop, especially since 17-inch gaming laptops with desktop-class CPUs and GPUs like the Alienware Area-51m,\\xa0Acer Predator Helios 700\\xa0and Gigabyte Aorus 17X deliver desktop-level performance with convenience similar to an all-in-one. An all-in-one with a really fast, gaming-optimized display. Though big laptops like these usually support upgrades, it\\'s usually not as cheap or easy to do it as it is with even the least expensive gaming desktop.\\nChoosing the best gaming desktop for your gaming experience is all about trade-offs. Every game uses system resources -- processor (aka CPU), graphics processor (GPU), memory (RAM), storage -- differently, and often horribly inefficiently. You can\\'t even count on resource usage to be consistent across a specific game genre, such as first-person shooter, platformer or simulation, because optimization levels can vary wildly. Gaming (and content-creation) PCs are the angry toddlers of consumer electronics: They\\'re loud, willful and require constant supervision. And just when you think they\\'re under control, they veer off into crazy-town.\\nAs you configure your gaming rig, here are some considerations to keep in mind:\\nHP\\'s Pavilion Gaming Desktop is a compact, budget gaming friendly, spare-me-the-flashiness model, targeting the same \"casual\" gamer as Dell\\'s Inspiron Gaming or Acer\\'s Nitro lines, but a lot more understated. This $650 base model budget gaming PC should provide at least the minimum you need to play relatively undemanding games in 1080p without poking your eyes out with a stick: Intel Core i5-10400, GeForce GTX 1650, 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD storage. Those are the typical specs you\\'ll get for this cheap gaming PC price, but if you can afford it, bump up to 16GB RAM and a bigger SSD.\\nThe Pro model of the Corsair One I reviewed is oriented toward content creation, but it differs only from the PC gaming models by its processor -- Intel\\'s X series rather than K series -- which also makes the gaming systems cheaper. The Corsair One i164 is the gaming analog of the i200, with an i9-10900K instead of the i9-10940X and costs $900 less ($3,300). The entry model i145 is pretty well-equipped for $1,900, with an i7-9700F and GeForce RTX 2080 Super. The Corsair One models may not eke every bit of performance out of the components, but that\\'s the tradeoff for going with a petite powerhouse. The design is especially great for VR, thanks to HDMI and USB ports in the front.\\nRead our Corsair One Pro i200 review.\\n\\nMaingear\\'s Apex liquid-cooling system has a stunning, look-at-me-I-game style, plus it keeps high-end components like an\\xa0AMD Ryzen 5950X\\xa0and\\xa0Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080\\xa0chilled, quiet and running at top speed for your 4K gaming and heavy-duty simulation gameplay. And though it\\'s not the smallest of the small-form-factor desktops, it\\'s still more compact than a midtower -- just a little larger than two Xbox Series X consoles. The entry price will only get you a fairly staid-looking 1080p system, though; you\\'ll have to spend more to get both the flash and the speed.\\nRead our Maingear Turbo review.\\n\\nFalcon Northwest\\'s 2020 version of its midtower (38 liter) Talon case, formerly called the \"20th Anniversary Edition,\" is much improved over the older case and because FNW\\'s a custom builder you get a gazillion configuration options and pretty paint jobs. The configuration I tested was fast and stable. It\\'s not cheap, but it should last you a long time.\\nRead our Falcon Northwest Talon 20th Anniversary Edition review.\\n\\nThe Trident X packs top-flight components into a skinny chassis (only about 5 inches wide) and is surprisingly quiet for all its power. Plus, it looks a little more like a gaming system than the low-key Corsair models. \\xa0The RTX 20-series models have been discontinued and the RTX 30-series are in preorder, but prices start at about $2,400 with a 10th-gen Core i7, 32GB RAM, an RTX 3070 and a 1TB SSD.\\nRead our MSI MEG Trident X review.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure an all-in-one is the best route to go for gaming, partly because the built-in displays are all fixed at 60Hz refresh and they use mobile parts. But for PC gaming where a big (32 inches) 4K HDR screen may make a big impact, like simulations, HP\\'s RTX 20-series-equipped all-in-one can\\'t be beat. The model we tested was the RTX 2060 configuration; prices start at about $1,700 with a GTX 1650.\\nRead HP Envy 32 AIO review.\\n'),\n",

              "  \"As laptop manufacturers begin to roll out their 2022 models, now is a good time to scoop up a model from last year at a discount. With Intel announcing new 12th-gen Core processors and AMD rolling out new Ryzen chips at CES at the beginning of the year, retailers are slashing prices on current models to make way for new releases with the latest chips. You can also find savings on laptops with the latest Intel silicon.\\nAll but one of the picks here cost less than $1,000. At or near $800, the MSI Prestige 14 and Dell Inspiron 14 two-in-one provide 12th-gen Intel Core processors and an ample 16GB of RAM inside sleek, 14-inch designs that deliver enough screen real estate while still being eminently portable. The Samsung Galaxy Book 2 360 also boasts a 12th-gen Intel processor, a gorgeous design, and is a no-brainer if you use a Galaxy phone. And check out the Asus VivoBook 15, which supplies an OLED display for an unbelievably low price. I've also included other strong deals I've found at Amazon, Best Buy and Newegg.\\nCheck out the options below, which are regularly updated as sales expire and new deals emerge.\\nOLED for the masses! This midrange laptop from Asus boasts a 15.6-inch OLED display with 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution. Not only is it a step up from budget models that make you get by with a 720p screen, but it's also got an OLED panel that delivers stellar contrast. It's also thinner and lighter than any 15-inch budget model. Based on an 11th-gen Core i5 CPU and featuring 12GB of RAM and a 512GB solid-state drive, it has more memory and double the storage capacity that you'll find in most budget laptops. It also has both Type-A and Type-C USB ports, saving you from having to carry around an adapter. It's a good deal at its $800 list price and an even better deal at its current discount.\\nDell's entry-level Inspiron has an admittedly drab, plastic chassis, but it serves up a full-HD (1,920x1,080-pixel), 15.6-inch touch display powered by an 11th-gen, quad-core Core i5 processor along with 16GB of RAM and a huge 1TB SSD. That's double the memory and storage space you usually find at this price.\\nMSI's version of the MacBook boasts a thin, sleek, all-aluminum enclosure and has been updated with 12th-gen Intel processors. This model is $200 off at Newegg and features a 12th-gen Core i5 processor, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. You also get a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports. The 14-inch display features a full HD resolution but has the older 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio rather than the taller 16:10 ratio that provides more room to work. Still, this is a thin, light and rugged laptop and it's a great deal at its current sale price.\\nDell's latest 2-in-1 convertible is based on a 14-inch touchscreen with a 16:10 aspect ratio that gives you more vertical space than a widescreen 16:9 panel for less scrolling through webpages and documents. Inside, you get a new 12th-gen Intel Core i7 CPU along with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. This is a great pick for students who need a roomy display in a portable package with the latest Intel silicon. It's currently discounted by a hefty $250 at Best Buy.\\nThis 15-inch Pavilion 15 offers a well-rounded configuration for the money. Its 15.6-inch, full HD display is powered by an 11th-gen Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It features a basic, plastic chassis but it's fairly thin with a sleek, brushed aluminum finish. It also supplies both USB-A and USB-C ports so you don't have to carry a dongle with you to connect your USB devices.\\nThis budget-to-midrange laptop from HP may have an uninspired plastic enclosure, but if you care more about screen size, memory allotment and storage space than you do about a sleek design, then this model is worth checking out. It should offer decent performance, too, with double the RAM and solid-state storage usually included on most other laptops at this price. At this price, you can usually find 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, but sometimes less. In that light, the 32GB of memory and the 1TB SSD here are downright thrilling. You also get a full-HD (1,920x1,080-pixel) resolution for the roomy 17.3-inch display.\\nSamsung's sleek two-in-one convertible boasts an AMOLED display powered by the latest Intel silicon. The 13.3-inch touch display features a full HD resolution and can rotate 360 degrees into tablet mode. It's powered by a 12th-gen Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Like the previous-generation models, the Galaxy Book 2 360 is designed to work seamlessly with Galaxy phones and tablets. There are also larger 15.6-inch Galaxy Book 2\\xa0and 360 models on sale at Best Buy. They don't increase the screen resolution but do supply a 1080p webcam, which offers a clearer picture than the 720p camera on the 13.3-inch model.\\nMost 17-inch laptops are gaming monsters. The LG Gram 17 is neither a gaming laptop nor a monster. It lacks dedicated graphics to drive 3D games but is only 0.7 inch thick and weighs less than 3 pounds, making this 17.3-inch desktop replacement roughly the same weight as your typical 13.3-inch ultraportable. The spacious 2,560x1,600-pixel display is powered by an 11th-gen Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM and integrated Intel Iris Plus graphics. You also get a roomy 1TB SSD for storage and can save nearly\\xa0$400 on it right now.\\nRead our LG Gram 16 review.\\n\"),\n",

              "  \"Back in March, Insta360 introduced its One RS action cam. It has a modular design that allows you to swap out the actual camera lenses, giving you greater freedom to experiment when shooting. The new One RS 1-inch 360 Edition builds out the line with a fourth option for creating immersive content. With help from its engineering partner Leica, the dual-lens camera module uses two 1-inch image sensors for better image quality, especially in low-light conditions.\\nLarger sensors allow the camera to capture more light, producing photos and video with less noise and greater detail and dynamic range. As far as handheld 360 cameras go, this could have the best video quality available -- and it still fits in a pocket. It can capture video at up to 5,888x2,944-pixel resolution and 30 frames per second. Or you can get 6,144x3,072-pixel resolution at 25 or 24fps with a maximum bit rate of 120Mbps. Much of the other shooting features are the same as Insta360's other cameras.\\nThe increased sensor size will no doubt make this a better option for shooting outside at night or for some amazing sunrise or sunset motion time-lapses. It should also work nicely for anyone who wants to capture better details indoors without a lot of distracting image noise, which could make it useful for showing off real estate or other virtual tours. Insta360 also has a new mounting bracket for Rode Wireless Go mics, which is designed to disappear when recording 360 videos. The company's invisible selfie stick will work with this camera, too.\\nThe vertical mounting bracket has controls and access to a USB-C port for charging and transfers.\\nThe 1-inch 360 Lens connects to the existing One R and RS cores. But because the 1-inch sensors make it much larger than\\xa0the current 360 option for the One RS camera\\xa0the new module can't be connected to the horizontal battery pack included with the One R/RS camera cores. Instead, it uses a unique vertical battery and vertical mounting bracket.\\nThe Insta360 One RS 1-inch 360 Edition includes the 1-inch 360 camera module, RS core, battery and mounting bracket is available now for $800 (£810, AU$1,299). However, Insta360 also has an upgrade bundle for One R and RS owners that comes with just the lens, battery and bracket for $650 (£660, AU$1,099).\\nWhere Insta360 continues to separate itself from other companies that have made a 360 camera, past or present, is with its mobile apps and desktop software. They really lower the editing hurdles so much that you can create a completed, instantly shareable clip or photo in no time at all.\\nEven if you don't care about creating immersive 360 videos, this camera has more value for shooting traditional videos. The dual-lens design captures everything around the camera. Using the app, you can choose an opening shot and then set keyframes throughout the clip wherever and whenever you want to change the focus of the video. When it's played back, the video will smoothly pan around the shot to each keyframe. You can export in 9:16, 16:9, 1:1 and 2.35:1 aspect ratios.\\nStill, my favorite part of using Insta360's One cameras is the Shot Lab tutorials. They show you how to get the most from the cameras and, while the effects might not be ones you use all the time, they can definitely kick-start your creativity.\"),\n",

I\\'ve put together some of my personal favorites here.\\nSo, after you\\'ve jumped through the initial screens from the Mac Setup Assistant that had you log in with your Apple ID, connect to a network and so on, consider changing these settings, or at least check them out, on your new MacBook.\\nRead more: The Quickest Way to Transfer Your Files, Apps and More From Your Old MacBook\\nHas Apple released an update to MacOS since it built your MacBook? Find out by clicking the\\xa0Apple button\\xa0in the upper-left corner of your screen and then clicking\\xa0About This Mac. You should be staring at the\\xa0General\\xa0tab of the About This Mac window. If so, click the\\xa0Software Update\\xa0button, which will launch the System Preferences to check for updates.\\nIf your MacBook is going to spend most of its time plugged in, you\\'ll definitely want to change this setting. MacOS can learn your charging habits to reduce battery aging. Click on the battery icon on the menu bar at the top of your display and select Battery Preferences from the drop-down menu. (If you don\\'t see a battery icon, go to System Preferences > Energy Saver and check the box for Show battery status in menu bar.) At the bottom of the list of options, select Optimized battery charging. This will slow down your charging once the battery hits 80%.\\nSiri should be enabled by default, but if you would prefer to use Siri only on your iPhone, then you can disable Siri by going to System Preferences > Siri and unchecking the box for Enable Ask Siri. If you plan on using Siri frequently, then you can use this Siri window to choose Siri\\'s voice, language and a keyboard shortcut.\\nIf you have one of the last remaining Intel-based MacBook Pro models with the Touch Bar, then head to System Preferences > Keyboard and click the Customize Touch Bar\\xa0button and then simply drag the buttons you want to show up on the default view of the Touch Bar to the Touch Bar below the display. Don\\'t worry, they\\'ll make the leap from your display across the hinge and to the Touch Bar.\\nI find it incredibly useful to sync the Desktop and Documents folders between my two Macs and my iOS devices. To sync these two folders, go to System Preferences > Apple ID\\xa0and click\\xa0iCloud\\xa0in the left column and check the box next to\\xa0iCloud Drive. Click Options\\xa0next to iCloud Drive and select\\xa0Desktop and Documents folders.\\nEven though it uses more system resources than Safari, I use Chrome instead of Safari because the favicons help me keep track of all of my open tabs. To set a default browser, go to System Preferences > General and make a selection other than Safari for Default web browser.\\nA MacBook\\'s \"natural\" scrolling direction doesn\\'t feel natural to me. If you want the two-finger swipe gesture to scroll vertically in the opposite way, head to System Preferences > Trackpad and click on the Scroll & Zoom tab. Next, uncheck the box for Scroll direction: Natural.\\nApple throws a number of stock apps into the Dock at the bottom of the screen. You can make room for the apps you use most frequently by removing others you don\\'t need in the Dock. To remove an app from the Dock, simply click on its icon in the Dock and drag it to the desktop until you see Remove appear above the icon and then let go. Poof, it\\'s gone! To add an app to the Dock, open it and then right-click on its icon in the Dock and mouse over the Option line in the menu and click Keep in Dock.\\nThe Dock sits at the bottom of your screen, but on a widescreen MacBook display, you might find it better to have it on the side. To move the Dock, go to System Preferences > Dock & Menu Bar and choose either Left or Right for Position on Screen. While you\\'re there, you can also drag a slider to adjust the size of the Dock. You can also make it disappear from view when you aren\\'t using it by checking the box for Automatically hide and show the Dock.\\nLike an iPhone, a MacBook displays a small battery icon at the top of the display to show how much battery power remains. It\\'s more helpful if next to this icon the percentage of battery you have left is also displayed. To show the percentage, go to\\xa0System Preferences > Dock & Menu Bar\\xa0and choose Battery from the left column. Check the box next to Show Percentage and it should instantly appear next to the battery icon on the Menu Bar.\\nSafari now combats two of the bigger internet annoyances: autoplay videos and ad trackers. Ad tracking is stopped by default, but there is a global setting for stopping autoplay videos that you\\'ll want to enable. Open Safari\\'s Preferences and click on the Websites tab. Choose Auto-Play from the left panel and for When visiting other websites at the bottom of the window, select Never Auto-Play\\xa0or Stop Media with Sound (if you are okay with muted videos playing) and sit back and rejoice in the silence.\\nStaring at a blue screen before bed can shift your body\\'s natural clock and make it difficult to get a good night\\'s sleep. With Apple\\'s Night Shift feature, the colors of your display are shifted to the warmer end of the spectrum during the evening hours. Head to System Preferences > Displays and click the Night Shift tab. You can set Night Shift to come on from sunset to sunrise, or you can select a custom time period. Use the slider to adjust the color temperature of the effect between less warm and more. Once you start using Night Shift, you\\'ll wonder how you ever sat in front of a cold, blue screen in the evening hours.\\nWith MacOS Mojave,\\xa0Apple introduced a dynamic wallpaper\\xa0that slowly changes its lighting throughout the day, going from a bright, sunny desert scene during the day and transitioning to a cool, dark screen at night. You can find it by going to\\xa0System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver. While Mojave started out with just two dynamic wallpapers -- Mojave and Solar Gradients -- there are now several to choose from and sites where you can download more.\\nMacOS Mojave also delivered an honest-to-goodness dark mode for Macs. Go to\\xa0System Preferences > General\\xa0and you\\'ll see the\\xa0Light\\xa0and\\xa0Dark\\xa0options at the top for\\xa0Appearance. On most apps, dark mode turns the background black and text white. Want to use both Light and Dark options? Select Auto and buttons, menus and windows will change throughout the day.\\nAlong with overly blue screens, notifications have no place in my home after a certain hour. As with iOS, MacOS lets you disable notifications in the evening so you aren\\'t disturbed while watching Netflix or sleeping. Go to System Preferences > Notifications and check the box Turn on Do Not Disturb. By default, it\\'s set for the hours of 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. but you can set your own Do Not Disturb Window. There are options to enable the feature when your MacBook\\'s display is sleeping or when you are mirroring the display to a TV or projector (and presumably watching a movie or show or video). You can also let calls come through (if you use your MacBook to answer calls) or just repeated calls, which might mean there is an emergency or something urgent to which you may need to respond.\\nIf you want to download apps from the web at large and not just from the Mac App Store, you\\'ll need to tell MacOS to loosen up on the reins a bit. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy, click the General tab and then click the lock in the lower-left corner and enter your password to make changes. Next, for Allow apps downloaded from, choose App Store and identified developers.\\nWhile on the Security & Privacy page, you can set the length of time your MacBook can sit idle before the screen locks. It\\'s more convenient to set a longer time but also less secure. The time period to set here doesn\\'t start ticking until the screen saver begins, so you also need to set the length of time before your screen saver kicks in. Go to System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver and you can select the style of your screen saver and also the time by using the drop-down menu at the top of the window.\\n'),\n",

And with powerful cameras stuffed into phones like the\\xa0iPhone 13 Pro Max\\xa0and the\\xa0Galaxy S22 Ultra, along with a plethora of\\xa0amazing mirrorless cameras\\xa0from the likes of Canon, Sony and Fujifilm, getting great images doesn't mean hauling a huge kit bag with you on your travels.\\nHere, I'll take you through the essential gear you need to bring with you on your trip, whether you're jaunting on a jet to a tropical island, hiking into snowcapped mountains or spending a long weekend away in your local countryside.\\nI'll also recommend some extras to consider if you want to return home with creative pieces of art, rather than just plain holiday snaps.\\nRead more: I've Traveled the World For Years. These 7 Things Are Always on My Packing List\\nChoosing the proper camera is basically a balancing act between overall image quality and the physical size of the camera. Your phone, for example, is small and fits right in your pocket, but though top-end phones have multiple lenses and can take amazing shots, the enthusiasts among you will likely want to upgrade to a proper camera system that allows for lens swapping. If you do decide to go with just your phone, then make sure to check out CNET's phone photography 101 page\\xa0for a wide variety of shooting advice.\\nTraveling photographers have more choice than ever these days, with mirrorless cameras offering much smaller body sizes than the traditional DSLRs of previous years. Micro four-thirds cameras like the Fujifilm X-S10 are easily carried around your neck and are quick to operate, so you never miss a shot. I like to shoot on full-frame cameras, which have larger image sensors that offer better dynamic range -- ideal for pulling back highlights on those sunset shots, or raising the shadows of those nighttime images looking down old Italian avenues.\\nMy favorite option is the Canon EOS RP, a full-frame camera with an incredibly compact body size that makes it ideal for keeping in your backpack. Paired with a 24-105mm f4 lens, it can take wide-angle shots of sweeping landscapes and also zoom in to focus on smaller details. Having a broad zoom lens means you can probably do your whole trip with just the one lens and not feel weighed down with additional kit.\\nIf you want to travel exceptionally light, then Canon's recent 50mm f1.8 lens (often referred to as the Nifty Fifty) is incredibly small and light and when paired with the EOS RP makes for a superb street and travel setup, with a fast aperture that provides beautiful bokeh. If possible, take a look at the camera you're considering in a camera shop and see how it feels in your hand or when hanging around your neck. If you'll be doing a lot of hiking, or long walks around the city, then every bit of weight matters.\\nCanon's EOS RP offers full-frame quality but in a very compact size, particularly when paired with the tiny 50mm f1.8 lens.\\nA tripod isn't essential for all travel photography, but when the light fades and you need to slow the shutter speed to several seconds to get a good exposure, you'll need one to secure your camera. You'll definitely need a tripod if you want to nail those nighttime shots overlooking a gorgeous bay, capture the stars above those snowcapped mountains, or pull off those artful long exposures of waterfalls.\\nBy using a sturdy tripod, I was able to slow the shutter speed right down to capture the motion of the water and clouds over the Forth Bridge.\\nAgain, size matters and you should look for a compact, travel tripod that can easily fit in your backpack -- or attach to the outside of it. Modern materials like carbon fiber will keep the weight down, but they also tend to be more expensive, so you'll need to decide how much you're willing to shell out.\\nAs its name suggests, the Peak Design Travel Tripod is a great tripod for traveling, thanks to its small size when folded down and its light weight. I've done all-day hikes with this strapped to my back and barely noticed its presence -- something I can't say for most tripods. Make sure to check out my full roundup of the best tripods you can buy in 2022. Or, if weight is really an issue, you can even try using your own DIY tripod.\\nA dedicated photo bag should be high on your list -- after all, you don't want your fancy new gear getting knocked around and breaking, do you? A good bag will have compartments to keep your camera safe and secure but will also let you access it quickly. It's important, too, to find one that also has plenty of space to keep other items you'll need while out and about.\\nIf you're going to be out with it all day, then I recommend a backpack with two shoulder straps, rather than a single-strap messenger bag. It'll spread that weight over both your shoulders and keep you comfortable longer. Look for things like side-access zips, so you can quickly get your camera out when inspiration strikes; plenty of additional pockets for batteries and snacks; weather-resistant materials; and mounting points to help carry your tripod.\\nI've done a lot of the hard work for you in rounding up my top photography backpacks for 2022. There are options for all kinds of photography, from short city breaks to multiday hikes with lots of gear. Have a read-through, and make sure that what you're taking is suitable for where you're going.\\nAlways keeping your camera handy means you're ever ready to shoot when you see a good opportunity.\\nThe list above is really the essential stuff you'll need to take with you. How much more you bring will depend on how seriously you take your photography. Always consider having multiple spare batteries and a charger, as even the best cameras will tend to give you only a day of photos. There's nothing worse than getting to a beautiful afternoon destination only to find you exhausted your power in the morning. Keeping a spare in your bag will let you swap it out and keep on shooting into the evening.\\nIf your goal is to capture stunning landscape vistas, filters called graduated neutral density filters are well worth considering. These will darken only the top half of a photograph -- to help control an overly bright sky -- letting you capture an evenly exposed scene. Shop around for square filter sets that let you use adapter rings for a variety of lens sizes.\\nBy using a neutral density filter, I was able to blur the motion of the water until it became a smooth and silky surface.\\nIf you want to experiment with long exposures, then you'll benefit from solid neutral density filters. These will dim the light across the whole scene, allowing you to use longer shutter speeds without resulting in a photo that's completely washed out. The Big Stopper by Lee Filters is a superb filter, so dark it allows you to take photos several seconds long -- or even longer -- in broad daylight. For capturing cloud trails streaking across the sky, it's worth checking out, though it doesn't come cheap.\\nLooking for more photography tips?

              "  \"This story is part of Gift Guide, our year-round collection of the best gift ideas.\\nWith a smartphone in everyone's pocket these days, photography can be a bit misunderstood. While most people can take nice photos and post them on social media, nothing compares to a trained photographer who takes their craft seriously. That's why professional photographers will always be needed, especially for important events like graduations, weddings and the like. But it can be difficult to shop for a serious photographer.\\nThere are various camera options, from compact mirrorless cameras to DSLRs, with endless choices of accessories, tripods and bags. To help you find the ideal gift for the photographer in your life (or yourself), we've rounded up our top picks of the best cameras, tripods, drones, action cameras and photography accessories. Whether they're a keen landscape photographer or a budding vlogger, we've got gift ideas to fit all budgets.\\nCanon's EOS R5 has a slew of great features, including its amazing image stabilization, lightning-fast autofocus and quick burst shooting. But the R5's standout feature is its ability to shoot video in 8K resolution. While not everyone will need that many pixels, 8K can give a lot more scope for cropping and creative editing, making it a great choice for the dedicated videographer who's looking for the best camera gear.\\nWith a 24.1-megapixel sensor, a pop-up flash and a fairly compact size, Canon's Rebel T7 (also known as the 2000D) is a great DSLR for those looking to take their first steps in photography. This kit comes with a great all-round 18-55mm lens, as well as a 75-300mm zoom lens, making it the beginner's best camera gear to tackle everything from sweeping landscapes to close-up wildlife images.\\nRead our Canon EOS Rebel T7 preview.\\n\\nSony's vlogging-focused ZV-1 is small enough to fit into a pocket, packs a flip-out screen so you can see if you're in the frame when you're talking to your audience and can be bought with a handy grip that lets you easily start and stop recordings. The 4K video quality is great and while battery life could certainly be improved, we think keen YouTubers everywhere will appreciate adding this little thing to their production lineup.\\nThis is among the best camera gear options for an experienced photographer who wants the photo and video quality that only a full frame camera can produce. It's one generation old, but it's relatively small, packs an awesome 24.2-megapixel sensor, five-axis image stabilization and can be picked up for a price that shouldn't be too out of reach for photography enthusiasts.\\nRead our Sony A7 III preview.\\n\\nCanon's entry-level EOS RP packs an excellent 26.2-megapixel, full-frame image sensor into an extremely compact body that makes it superb for both beginners and enthusiastic travel photographers alike. It's easy to use, too, with a flip-out screen and convenient buttons while the increasingly broad range of Canon's RF-mount lenses means it's easy to find the right lens for your needs.\\nRead our Canon EOS RP preview.\\n\\nWith its 24.3-megapixel image sensor, its 4K video recording and its 5-axis in-camera image stabilization, the Nikon Z5 packs some impressive specs into a very compact, lightweight body. And it does it at a price that makes it a great option for the photographer looking to step up from a basic point-and-shoot and take photography a bit more seriously.\\nI've never shot with film before, but even I was excited to get my hands on the Goodman Zone DIY kit. This medium format film camera arrives in a multitude of 3D-printed pieces, with instructions on how to build, customize and use your own camera. It's a fairly straightforward process -- and the feeling of going out to take images with a camera you've literally put together yourself is something quite special.\\nYou'll need to source your own lens and film (Dora Goodman's website provides plenty of advice on this) but at $105\\xa0it's a very affordable way to dip your toe into the world of medium-format film photography with some of the best camera gear that's budget-friendly.\\nWhen moving at high speeds, nothing beats an action camera for sharing the most breathless moments. The latest version of this excellent little action cam can shoot video at up to 5.2K resolution at 50 frames per second or up to 120fps at 4K for some silky slow motion action. It has incredible stabilization and the overall video quality is superb.\\nRead our GoPro Hero 10 Black hands on.\\n\\nDJI's smallest drone can be squeezed comfortably into a jacket pocket, but its camera is capable of taking beautiful videos and photos thanks to its 4K resolution and ability to shoot still images in raw format. It's very easy to fly too, making it a great option for beginners, or more enthusiastic aerial photographers who want to travel as light possible. We're linking to the Fly More Combo below, which includes extra batteries and other niceties, but you can save by buying the basic drone kit.\\nThe Lumix G9 can take great still images thanks to its 20.3-megapixel image sensor, but is also able to shoot smooth 4K video with its in-body stabilization. That makes it great for photographers who want to get great stills on their next outdoor adventure, but also want to put lovely video together for their Instagram Reels or TikTok.\\nRead our Panasonic Lumix G9 preview.\\n\\nRode's VideoMicro might be small, but it's capable of capture professional-level audio from the top of your camera, without needing any batteries or external power source, making it ideal for vlogging. In fact, it's among the best camera gear options for vloggers. It plugs directly into the microphone port on your camera (such as the one on the EOS M50 above) and can be bought with a cable that's compatible with smartphones, if that's more your thing. It comes with a sturdy shockmount as well as a big, fluffy windshield which will help you get crystal clear audio, even in difficult or windy conditions.\\nWith cameras shooting stills and videos at ever-increasing resolutions, it's easier than ever to run out of storage when you're out in the field. Thankfully, storage doesn't have to break the bank and this 256GB SD card from SanDisk packs a huge amount of space for your files and comes with a very reasonable price tag attached. It's an ideal option for beginners wanting one card they never need to worry about filling up, while being cheap enough for enthusiasts to buy several to make sure they can always keep on shooting. Just make sure the camera it's going in supports SD cards up to 256GB in size.\\nLowePro has been a staple of the photography bag world for years and with the ProTactic 450 it's easy to see why. This rugged backpack opens fully from the back, although there are side and top quick-access points too. It provides a wealth of storage slots for a DSLR, multiple lenses, filters, batteries and other accessories -- I even stuffed a small drone in amongst my gear.\\nIf you can't quite fit everything inside, you can get additional accessory pouches that attach to the outside of the case, where you can also attach your tripod. It's comfortable to carry thanks to both chest and hip straps, it's made of durable materials and it has a zipped compartment for laptops up to 15 inches.\\nIts compact size makes this backpack comfortable and light to take around the city as you hunt for the best coffee and street food, but its internal space offers lots of room for cameras, lenses and even compact drones. With dual side-access pockets, it's easy to get to your camera when creativity strikes while the weatherproof material will keep your expensive gear safe if the rain starts to come down.\\nPeak Design's Travel Tripod, as it's known, is best for exactly what its name suggests: traveling. It's one of the best camera gear choices for those who want to travel light. The carbon fiber version weighs only 2.8 lbs (1.27kg) and packs down to only 15.4 inches (39.1cm) long, making it easy to chuck in a backpack or camera bag. The aluminum tripod model weighs 3.4 lbs (1.5kg).\\nIts ball head is quick and easy to use, it's sturdy enough to hold a professional DSLR and it comes with its own grip so you can mount your phone on the tripod that tucks away inside the central column. It's all extremely well thought-out and feels reassuringly sturdy.\\nPhotography filters come in all shapes and sizes, but few are as well thought-out or as high quality as Polar Pro's. With aluminum frames, each filter is sturdy, easy to hold and convenient to slot into the filter holder. The landscape set comes with a circular polarizer, two neutral density filters and a graduated neutral density filter to help balance bright skies in your landscape photos. It's an essential set for the keen landscape photographer in your life.\\nThe 3 Legged Thing Bucky is a super tripod for almost any photography situation. Its carbon fiber construction means it's light enough to comfortably strap to a backpack, it packs down small but its maximum height of over 6.2 feet (191cm) makes it extremely tall too. I've found it brilliant for landscape photography as it's no trouble to carry out into the hills, but I can still shoot at eye level.\\nIts ball head is secure enough to hold even the weightiest DSLRs with a big zoom lens attached, its legs can be detached to use as monopods, and its solid construction means you don't need to worry about it taking a few knocks on the road. It doesn't come cheap, but photography enthusiasts in any genre are well catered for here.\"),\n",

              "  \"If you own any kind of modern Mac, there are three basic ways to take a screenshot with keyboard shortcuts -- and if you have a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar there's even a fourth method. Apple's MacOS software also gives you a fair number of options to easily save, delete and open the screenshot for markup.\\nThese tips also apply to the latest Macs, as Apple has recently updated the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a new M2 chip, while a similar MacBook Air, with a much deeper physical redesign, is coming soon.\\nThis keyboard shortcut captures a screenshot of your entire screen.\\nUse this keyboard combo to turn your cursor into a crosshair, which you can drag to select a portion of your screen to capture. Release the mouse button or trackpad to take the shot.\\nYou have a number of other options after hitting Cmd-Shift-4:\\nPress and release the spacebar: The crosshair turns into a little camera icon, which you can move over any open window. Click on your desired window to take a screenshot of it. A screenshot captured by this method features a white border around the window with a bit of a drop shadow.\\nPress and hold the spacebar\\xa0(after dragging to highlight an area but before releasing the mouse button or trackpad): This locks in the shape and size of the selection area but lets you reposition it on the screen. It's very handy if your initial selection area is off by a few pixels; just hold down the spacebar to reposition it before releasing the mouse button to snap a screenshot.\\nHold down the Shift key\\xa0(after dragging to highlight an area but before releasing the mouse button or trackpad): This locks in each side of the selection area made with the crosshairs save the bottom edge, letting you move your mouse up or down to position the bottom edge.\\nWithout releasing the mouse button, release the Shift key and hit it again to reposition the right edge of your selection area. You can toggle between moving the bottom edge and right edge by keeping the mouse button or touchpad engaged and pressing the Shift key.\\nA shortcut command introduced way back in MacOS Mojave in 2018, Cmd-Shift-5 calls up a small panel at the bottom of your display with your screen capture options. There are three screenshot buttons that let you capture the entire screen, a window or a selection of your screen.\\nLikewise, the two video-recording buttons let you record your entire screen or a selection of it. On the left is an X button to close the screenshot panel, but you can also just hit the Escape key to exit out.\\nOn the right side is an Options button. It lets you choose where to save your screenshot -- Desktop, Documents, Clipboard, Mail, Messages, Preview or Other Location, and set a 5- or 10-second delay so you can line up items that might otherwise disappear when you engage your screenshot tool.\\nBy default, the Show Floating Thumbnail option is enabled, which puts a little preview thumbnail of your just-captured screenshot in the lower-right corner of your screen, similar to the screenshot procedure with iOS. Unlike on your iPhone, you can turn off this preview thumbnail on your Mac. Lastly, you can choose to show your mouse pointer in a screenshot or video.\\nIf the screenshot panel is in your way, you can grab its left edge and drag it to a new spot on your screen.\\nIf you've got an older 15- or\\xa016-inch MacBook Pro or a current 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is the very last model with the Touch Bar, you can also take a screenshot of what's currently showing on the Touch Bar. Just hit Cmd-Shift-6 to take a very wide and skinny screenshot of your Touch Bar.\\nIf you embrace the Floating Thumbnail, you'll gain quick access to Markup tools to annotate your screenshot. You can swipe the Floating Thumbnail away or just let it slip away on its own and it'll be saved to the spot you last saved a screenshot. Click the Floating Thumbnail and it'll open in a Markup View preview window (but not Preview) with all of the markup tools you get in Preview.\\nYou can right-click the Floating Thumbnail to:\\nLongtime Mac screenshotters may be slow to adopt the Cmd-Shift-5 shortcut, but I find myself using it more for the ability to annotate screenshots without needing to open Preview, and quickly delete screenshots that I know immediately I messed up. The 5- and 10-second delay options are also useful and appreciated additions.\"),\n",

This works to our advantage as you can get a printer that offers you better results for much cheaper than before.\\nIf you're a first-time buyer then finding a good 3D printer deal is even more important. All of the best 3D printers have advanced features that make your life easier, so if you can snag one for under the normal price, you can get ahead of the game.\\n\\nI've put together this list of deals from across the internet to save you from wandering around. CNET's team will keep it updated as new deals come in, and the old ones go away. While there are several companies that sell 3D printers, only Amazon regularly has sales. You might see other companies come up from time to time, but this list will be predominantly Amazon.\\nSome of the best deals use coupons, so keep an eye out and make sure you check the box when you reach the product page to claim your discount.\\nThis is Anycubic's newest entry-level 3D printer, but it includes some more advanced systems. Auto bed leveling, and crash detection help greatly when you're starting out and even seasoned makers appreciate the features. Any time a printer with auto bed leveling dips below $300, it's worth considering, and at $272 the Kobra is a great starting point. Just remember to clip the coupon too.\\nThe Saturn isn't the newest of Elegoo's printers but it still creates results that are hard to beat, even by newer models. If you clip the Amazon coupon you can save $120, making it the cheapest it's been since Black Friday.\\nThe Photon 4K is being replaced with the new M3 series, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth your time. The 4K monochrome screen makes the printer very fast without sacrificing any details. In fact, the details on this machine are superb, especially on small models like miniatures.\\nAt $194 the Photon 4K offers an amazing entry into resin 3D printing, even if Anycubic is selling off the stock. Grab one while you can\\nThe Snapmaker 2 is more than just a 3D printer; it's a CNC mill and laser etching machine as well. It's like having your own little maker space. This is the lowest price the A350 -- the biggest of the Snapmaker models -- has ever been, making it the perfect time to snap it up.\\nI normally don't recommend 3D printers without heated beds but this teeny little printer is such a fun little thing it seems like a no-brainer. At just $109 this is an impulse buy that you can get for your child, as a Father's Day gift, or even for your teacher at school. Get one -- heck, get two, just for the laughs.\\n3D printers are modular in design, so it is very easy to take them apart and rebuild them to be as good as new. Refurbished 3D printers don't come along often, but if you are lucky you can find some excellent bargains.\\nThe Pulse XE is perfect for those of us who want to try more exotic filaments. If you are looking to add some carbon fiber, high-temperature Nylon or even just glow-in-the-dark PLA, then the Pulse is for you.\\nMatterhackers makes all of its Pulse XE printers in-house in California, so when they refurb one, they simply replace the worn parts with brand new ones. That makes these refurbished deals an excellent buy.\"),\n",

Maybe you already have an\\xa0iPhone\\xa0or a\\xa0MacBook\\xa0and want to stay in the Apple family. Or maybe you\\'re thinking of jumping from an Android tablet to something that gives you access to the iPad\\'s apps. Regardless of your reasons, if you\\'re thinking of buying an Apple tablet, there\\'s a good selection to choose from.\\nApple introduced an\\xa0iPad Air 2022\\xa0for the first time since 2020 at\\xa0its \"Peek Performance\" event in March, outfitting the new tablet with 5G support, an M1 processor and a\\xa0Center Stage front-facing camera. We also have our eyes on a\\xa0new iPad Pro possibly coming this year, but for now, the\\xa0iPad Pro 2021\\xa0is the newly announced Air\\'s closest rival.\\xa0 We\\'ll update our recommendations after we\\'ve gotten a chance to test the new Air, but both its more powerful configuration and the possibility of a new Pro should make you hit \"pause\" on any potential iPad Pro purchase.\\nRead more:\\xa0Best iPad Deals Right Now\\nWhichever model or screen size you go with, though, all the current iPads support the latest version of\\xa0iPadOS\\xa0(a version of iOS specifically for iPads) and either the first- or second-gen Apple Pencil. All but the Mini work with Apple\\'s Smart Keyboard, though you can use any Bluetooth keyboard instead. That\\'s good news for anyone who wants to do more than stream videos and music, browse websites and play Apple Arcade games. Plus, all of the current iPad models support mouse and trackpad use for a more MacBook-like experience. The Apple Magic Keyboard is compatible with the iPad Pro and iPad Air. Check out the selections below to find the best iPad for your needs.\\nMore advice follows our specific recommendations.\\nThe new ninth-gen entry level iPad gains a couple of useful extras over last year\\'s solid but unexciting model: more storage for $329 (64GB, rather than the ridiculously low 32GB of the last model), a faster A13 chip and better cameras (most importantly, a wider-angle higher-res front-facing\\xa0Center Stage camera\\xa0that tracks your face via digital pan and zoom). It still uses the first-gen Apple Pencil, which is fine for the money, and it\\'s still compatible with a range of keyboard cases. Its predecessors were often on sale for $299 or less and that should be true this holiday season as well.\\nIf you\\'re planning to do any sort of art on it or download a lot of videos to go, it\\'s definitely worth opting for the 256GB model. It really needs a 128GB option -- it\\'s annoying that you\\'re forced to buy more than you need, since 128GB would probably be the sweet spot for price and storage.\\nThe 2020 model has the slower A12 Bionic chip, but it\\'s also the last remaining full-size iPad with a headphone jack. Going back yet another generation to its seventh incarnation, it\\'s still a decent pick if you can find the 128GB model for a pittance; you\\'re best off avoiding the insufficient 32GB model. It can handle the latest iPadOS just fine and should perform all the standard iPad tasks for some years to come.\\nRead our iPad 2021 review.\\n\\nThe new iPad\\'s price starts at $100 more than the older iPad model it replaces at $499; that\\'s certainly not cheap, but you also get a lot more with it than you do with the now dated iPad Air. It\\'s just a little smaller than that, but it offers optional 5G, USB-C for faster charging and broader connectivity, new digital-zoom Center Stage camera and works with second-gen Pencils, so you can magnetically snap a Pencil right onto the side, which is nice. Plus it incorporates the new A15 Bionic chip for better performance. You might feel a bit cramped for using it for work or professional graphics, but 8.3 inches doesn\\'t feel quite so tiny anymore. This smallest iPad has a Liquid Retina display with True Tone and wide color, and promises up to 10 hours of battery life. Given that the 2021 model remains the smallest in the line, we continue to recommend it as the best option for commuters.\\nRead our Apple iPad Mini 2021 review.\\n\\nWhether you\\'re a digital artist or have waited years for a new iPad Pro that blurs the line between tablet and MacBook, the latest iPad Pro is what you want. The 11- and 12.9-inch Pros are nearly the same, save for their screen sizes and higher resolution and XDR technology in the 12.9-inch version based on Mini LED display backlighting technology. If you\\'re an intensive user of graphics apps like those in Adobe Creative Cloud, you\\'ll definitely appreciate the higher performance of the M1-driven Pro.\\nIf you\\'re considering the 11-inch iPad Pro as a laptop replacement, we recommend you spring for the 12.9-inch version for the significant increase in workspace; if you\\'re a screen buff, you may also want it for the Liquid Retina XDR display. Also note that there\\'s a price jump when you get a 1TB or 2TB model, because the RAM doubles from 8GB to 16GB for those who really need as much power as possible.\\nAlong with the increased performance, these were the first iPads to offer support for wireless 5G connectivity, though now Apple has expanded the 5G option to other models in the line. They\\'re still not quite the MacBook replacement some crave, but they\\'re getting closer every year.\\nRead our iPad Pro 2021 review.\\n\\nThe\\xa0newest iPad Air has the same starting price ($599) and starting storage (64GB) as it did a year and a half ago, but adds an M1 processor similar to the iPad Pro from 2021, a 5G option and a\\xa0Center Stage front-facing camera. It looks fast, and it\\'s sure to be a welcome power upgrade from the 2020 model, but it leaves off a bunch of little perks that the iPad Pro has.\\nRead more:\\xa0The Best iPad Games You Need to Play\\nThe current 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models as well as the 2022 Air are powered by the company\\'s M1 processor, the chip found in its latest MacBooks as well as the new 24-inch iMac. Along with the new processors, the iPad Pros have a Liquid Retina XDR display, at least on the 12.9-inch size, high-speed Thunderbolt USB-C port and optional 5G mobile wireless. The 11-inch version starts at $799 while the 12.9-inch model price begins at $1,099. The iPad Air starts at $599.\\nRead more: Which iPad Should You Buy Now?\\nSort of. Its processor is as powerful as a MacBook Air\\'s and it works with Bluetooth keyboards and Apple trackpads. But it\\'s held back from acting as a true replacement by iPadOS; that means, among other things, no useful dual-monitor support (it can only mirror, not extend, to a second display) and no support for full desktop applications. Though you might pooh-pooh the latter -- after all, Apple says you can do it all with an iPad -- for most school and work requirements you\\'ll find at least one thing you need to do on a laptop. For instance, even if I could do my job on an iPad Pro (and it\\'s not even close), in order to access some corporate locations I have to run the VPN, which is only available on company-issued systems.\\nMany limitations of current mobile apps have carried through into iPadOS. In some cases it may just because developers are still building out apps and haven\\'t yet gotten them yet to full featuredom, though there\\'s no guarantee they ever will get there. Adobe Lightroom is a fine \"light\" Lightroom, but Adobe intended it from the start to be mobile-first, and thus lack some features important to professionals, including wired tethered shooting, optimization for local file storage (rather than cloud) and the ability to intelligently handle raw+JPEG.\\nRead more: Is the iPad Pro Your Next Laptop?'),\n",

              "  \"Whether you're looking for a small, lightweight laptop, a two-in-one made for creatives and creators, a powerful gaming laptop or a simple, streamlined Chromebook, HP makes some of the best laptops available. Many of the best HP laptops right now have features to improve remote or hybrid work or school such as improved webcams and microphones, better audio quality, longer battery lives and faster charging and the fastest Wi-Fi 6 wireless.\\nLike other PC makers such as Dell, Lenovo, Acer and Asus, HP is in the midst of updating the processors in its laptops and two-in-ones. That means Intel-based models are moving from 11th-gen to 12th-gen CPUs while AMD Ryzen systems are switching from 5000-series chips to 6000-series. This means it's generally a good time to look for deals on older models of the best HP laptops. However, we've also seen big performance improvements with the new processors. An updated model might cost a little more but will add to the overall longevity.\\nHP packed a lot of value into the Aero 13: eye-pleasing magnesium-aluminum chassis, strong processing performance, long battery life, a bright, colorful display and a weight of just 2 pounds (0.94 kilograms). Amazingly, with all that it offers though, it has a regular starting price of less than $700. HP Pavilion Aero 13 review.\\nIf you're making a laptop aimed at creatives, it's not enough to just put discrete graphics and a strong processor in a slim body. The extra performance really should be paired with a good screen, and that's what you get with the HP Envy 14. The laptop's 16:10 14-inch 1,920x1,200-pixel display not only gives you more vertical room to work, but is color-calibrated at the factory and covers\\xa0100% of the sRGB color gamut. The result: a well-rounded option for creatives looking for on-the-go performance at a reasonable price. This model is due for a refresh, though, so keep an eye out for updated models.\\xa0\\xa0HP Envy 14 review.\\nSpectre is HP's top consumer laptop line so you're getting the best of the best with this 16-inch two-in-one.\\nOf course, a premium two-in-one like the Spectre x360 comes at a relatively high price; it starts at around $1,200. The top-end configuration we reviewed was good but not great considering its $2,030 price. This is definitely one we recommend getting with the 12th-gen Intel processors and Intel Arc graphics if you're going to go all-in. HP Spectre x360 16 review.\\nHP's Victus 16 is a surprisingly robust and powerful gaming laptop that keeps up with the latest games at a more affordable price. Compared to HP's high-end Omen gaming laptop line, the Victus is more of an all-purpose laptop but still configured for gaming with a price starting at less than $1,000. HP offers several configurations with graphics chip options ranging from Nvidia's entry-level GeForce GTX 1650 up to a midrange RTX 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6500M. We like almost everything about it except for its flimsy display hinge and underwhelming speakers. HP Victus 16 review.\\nThere are plenty of convertible Chromebooks, where the screen flips around to the back of the keyboard so you can use it as a tablet. But Chrome tablets with removable keyboards like the HP Chromebook x2 11 are still a rarity. It offers long battery life and performance that rises (slightly) above the competition. The main downside is that it's expensive; the model we reviewed is $599. However, that price did include both the keyboard cover and USI pen and it's regularly on sale for $200. If you're interested make sure to wait for one of those deals.\\xa0HP Chromebook x2 11 review.\"),\n",

Some travelers even plans their trips around movie landmarks and immortalize their stops on Instagram. But it\\'s not all superficial. Movies can actually give you a sense of a country\\'s past and culture.\\nTaking time to appreciate how a location sees itself or to examine a country\\'s past can enrich a vacation. Finding the right movie can even transform your trip from an excursion for staging the perfect selfie into something much more significant\\xa0 and memorable.\\nBelow are a list of vacation destinations -- and movies that help them come to life before you\\'ve even boarded a plane.\\nNote: CNET may get a share of revenue from the sale of the products featured on this page.\\nMust-see movie: Midnight in Paris\\nA visit to Paris isn\\'t complete without a trip to the Eiffel Tower.\\nWhy you need to see it: If you\\'re headed to the City of Lights, this film isn\\'t to be missed. Midnight in Paris follows the structure of Ernest Hemingway\\'s memoir of his time in Paris and centers on writer Gil Pender (Owen Wilson). Gil is vacationing in Paris with his fiancee (Rachel McAdams) when he\\'s mysteriously transported back to the city in the 1920s. Through most of the film, Pender follows a young Hemingway (Corey Stoll) around the nooks and crannies of Paris meeting iconic figures like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí.\\nMore films to watch: Amélie, Paris, Je T\\'Aime (Paris, I love You), An American in Paris, Funny Face and French Kiss.\\nMust-see movie: The King\\'s Speech\\nIt\\'ll take far more than one trip to make a dent in London\\'s rich history.\\nWhy you need to see it: An impeccably acted examination of Queen Elizabeth\\'s past, The King\\'s Speech focuses on the current monarch\\'s father, the late George VI (Colin Firth). After the king\\'s brother abdicates the throne to marry, George VI, the next in line, must overcome his stammer with the help of language therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffery Rush) to make his first wartime radio broadcast when Britain declares war on Germany in 1939. If you\\'re still not sold on this film by this stellar cast, Queen Elizabeth gave the movie her seal of approval after a private viewing.\\nMore films to watch: Atonement, The Imitation Game, The Queen, Shaun of the Dead and The Young Victoria.\\nMust-see movie: Hecho En México\\nAcapulco sits on the Pacific side of the country.\\nWhy you need to see it: There\\'s more to Mexico than what\\'s found in shoot-em-up films. To get a better picture of Mexican culture, you can watch Hecho En México, a documentary that focuses on artists and performers.\\nThe documentary shows that Mexican music goes beyond Mariachi bands and offers a glimpse of breathtaking locations, vibrant festival music and the rhythm of everyday life around the clock.\\nThese are the sights, sounds, colors, dance and spirituality that produced such talents as Diego Luna (Cassian Andor in Star Wars Rogue One), singer-songwriter Julieta Venegas, superstar Salma Hayek and more.\\nMore films to watch: Roma, Book of Life, Under the Same Moon (La Misma Luna) and Frida.\\nMust-see movie: Australia\\nThere\\'s more to Australia than kangaroos, but they\\'re so cute.\\nWhy you need to see it: Besides this sweeping romance\\'s amazing cast (Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman) and director (Baz Luhrmann), Australia encapsulates an important time in the country\\'s history.\\nSet just before World War II, the 2008 film touches on Australia\\'s Aboriginal peoples with the character Nullah. Some critics say the film doesn\\'t go deep enough into the casual racism and policies of displacement. But a Herald Sun critic called the film a \"love letter to the Australian landscape and [its] history.\"\\nMore films to watch: Tracks, The Dressmaker and Walkabout.\\nMust-see movies: Slumdog Millionaire and Lion\\nThe Taj Mahal is the most iconic spot in India.\\nWhy you need to see it: If you\\'re headed to India, watch both of these two cinematic gems. Slumdog Millionaire and Lion are based on true stories that showcase the endurance of the human spirit. They both star Academy Award nominee Dev Patel.\\nLion is the story of Saroo, who at 5 years old gets lost on a train and must survive on his own in Kolkata. He\\'s eventually adopted by an Australian family and, years later, sets out to find his mother with only a few memories and modern-day technology.\\nIn Slumdog Millionaire, brothers Jamal and Salim Malik, who live in poverty, must fend for themselves after their mother dies As they grow up, Jamal falls in love with childhood friend Latika and tries to keep them away from the life of crime that Salim chooses. When Jamal lands on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, the hosts believe he\\'s cheating as he recounts his life and gets questions right.\\nMore films to watch: Life of Pi, Trishna, The Darjeeling Limited and Monsoon Wedding.\\nMust-see movie: Bread and Tulips (Pane e tulipani)\\nA gondola ride is almost mandatory if you\\'re visiting Venice.\\nWhy you need to see it: If you\\'re going to Italy, don\\'t you want something authentically Italian? In Bread and Tulips, Rosalba (Licia Maglietta), a dissatisfied housewife, is left behind at a cafe during a bus trip. Her family doesn\\'t notice her absence, so Rosalba decides to reinvent herself in Venice. She begins an adventure in the beautiful city, making new friends and possibly falling in love.\\nMore films to watch: Call Me by Your Name, Only You, Roman Holiday and Letters to Juliet.\\nMust-see movie: The Impossible\\nKo Poda Island looks like the perfect place to vacation.\\nWhy you need to see it: The Impossible will whisk you away to the lush greenery, crystal blue waters and pristine beaches of Thailand. The film also pays homage to the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami that claimed more than 200,000 lives in 2004, to the kindness of strangers and to the resiliency of humans. The Impossible is based on the true story of the Belon family. While on vacation, the Belons are separated when the massive wave hits their resort. The injured family members must find their way back to each other in the raging waters. It\\'s a movie that\\'ll leave you with chills. Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts give unforgettable performances. And don\\'t forget to look out for a tiny Tom Holland (Spiderman: Far From Home).\\nMore films to watch: Railway Man, The Beach, The King and Cemetery of Splendor.\\nMust-see movie: Anne Frank: The Whole Story (two-part miniseries)\\nGrab a bike once you get to Amsterdam.\\nWhy you need to see it: If you\\'re headed to Amsterdam, odds are you\\'re also visiting the Anne Frank House, where young Anne wrote her famous diary while hiding with her family from Nazi deportation. There\\'s no shortage of films to watch about the incredible young woman whose life was so tragically cut short. This film stars Hannah Taylor-Gordon as Anne and Ben Kingsley as her father, Otto Frank. It\\'s not easy to watch at times, but it\\'s a significant part of history.\\nMore films to watch: The Diary of Anne Frank, The Book Thief, Monuments Men and Inglorious Basterds.\\nMust-see movie: Memoirs of a Geisha\\nThe Himeji Castle is great day trip while you\\'re in Japan.\\nWhy you need to see it: While Memoirs of a Geisha is classified as historical fiction, the film was adapted from a book by Arthur Golden. Golden\\'s book reportedly used the life of Mineko Iwasaki, a real geisha, as a source. Iwasaki has disputed some of Golden\\'s telling and released her own memoir, Geisha of Gion. By itself, Memoirs of a Geisha is a stunning film set in the 1920s about a girl named Chiyo, who at 9 years old, is forced into servitude. Eventually, Chiyo begins training to become one of the most beautiful and influential geishas in Japan as WWII looms.\\nMore films to watch: The Wind Rises, Spirited Away, 13 Assassins and Letters from Iwo Jima.\\nMust-see movie: Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom\\nA sunset in South Africa.\\nWhy you need to see it: Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom\\xa0follows Nelson Mandela\\'s life as he protests tyrannical apartheid in the 1940s and is then arrested and sentenced to life in prison. While in prison, his wife, Winnie, and their children keep the freedom movement going. Mandela went on to become the first democratically elected president of South Africa and an inspiration to the world.\\nMust-see movie: Disney Nature: African Cats\\nWhy you need to see it: If you\\'re more excited about the sight-seeing in Africa (or your kids aren\\'t exactly fascinated by the other film), you might like Disney Nature: African Cats. The documentary was filmed in the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya and follows two cat families. Sita is a mother cheetah with five adorable cubs, and Mara is the cub of Layla and Fang, the rulers of their pride. It\\'s a story about family and survival set against a breathtaking African landscape. But if you\\'re like me and tiny, baby animals trigger the waterworks for you, just have a box of tissues nearby.\\nMore films to watch: Cairo Time (Cairo), The Last Storytellers: Tales from the Heart of Morocco, and The Sheltering Sky (Algeria and Niger).\\nMust-see movie: Moana\\nThese islands in French Polynesia look as close to paradise as you can get.\\nWhy you need to see it: I\\'m not even ashamed to say as a grown woman that Moana is one of my favorite movies. Moana Waialiki is the daughter of an island chief, and she desperately wants to explore the oceans. When her island can no longer catch fish or keep crops alive, she learns that the demigod Maui is to blame because he stole the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. Moana sets sail on a journey of self discovery with Maui to save her island.\\nMore films to watch: Kon Tiki, South Pacific, The Land Has Eyes (Routma) and Heartbeats of Fiji.\\nMust-see movie: Endless Poetry (Poesía Sin Fin)\\nMountains set off Chile\\'s capital city, Santiago.\\nWhy you need to see it: See Chile from a true Chilean\\'s point of view. Filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky\\'s vibrant autobiographical movie, Endless Poetry, gives you a glimpse of Santiago in the 1940s. Jodorowsky leaves his strict family behind, dives into a bohemian lifestyle alongside what will become some of the best-known talents in Hispanic literature. There, Jodorowsky sets out to become a poet.\\nMore films to watch: Behind the Sun, The House of Sand and Kiss of the Spider Woman.\\nMust-see movie: Pan\\'s Labyrinth\\nBarcelona\\'s churches are breathtaking.\\nWhy you need to see it: This is one of the strangest films you might watch. Pan\\'s Labyrinth is set in 1944 Spain, just after the Spanish Civil War. Ofelia lives with her stepfather and sickly pregnant mother. Reality blurs with the abandoned labyrinth Ofelia finds and the magical creatures that inhabit it. Guillermo Del Toro\\'s films are never lacking in deeper meanings and beautiful cinematography, too.\\nMore films to watch: Ocho Apellidos Vascos (Spanish Affair), The Queen of Spain and En La Ciudad (In the City).\\nMust-see movie: Made in Jamaica\\nA resort in Jamaica.\\nWhy you need to see it: When I think of Jamaica, perfect beaches, swaying palm trees, vibrant colors and reggae music come to mind. The music is an integral part of the country\\'s culture. Made in Jamaica is a musical documentary that looks at how reggae has influenced popular culture. The film celebrates a musical movement\\'s influences on R&B, rap and more.\\nMore films to watch: Chrissy, Elza (Le bonheur d\\'elza) and Home Again.\\nMust-see movie: Mao\\'s Last Dancer\\nYou\\'ll definitely get your steps at the Great Wall of China.\\nWhy you need to see it: Mao\\'s Last Dancer is the true story of Li Cunxin, who grew up in Maoist China. Li is taken from his family and undergoes rigorous training to become a dancer.\\xa0 He\\'s accepted to Madame Mao\\'s Dance Academy, though he shows little interest in performance at first.\\nEventually, Li is spotted by an American ballet director and joins the Houston Ballet in America. His three-month stay in America and relationship with an American dancer leave him questioning his life back Communist China. Li is caught between his passion for dance, America and his home in China where his parents still live in poverty.\\nMore films to watch: The Last Emperor, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, Seven Years in Tibet and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\\nMust-see movie: Mamma Mia\\nQuaint streets in the Cyclades.\\nWhy you need to see it: Mamma Mia is a campy rom-com set to the music of Abba, but the sweeping camera work will transport you to the sun-drenched Greek islands. The story is about a young woman about to get married who wants her father to walk her down the aisle. The trouble is, there are three possibilities about who that is. Her equally free-spirited mother is shocked when all three men show up on their island to see if they are the father.\\nMore films to watch: Antigone, Captain Corelli\\'s Mandolin and My Life in Ruins.'),\n",

              "  'Amazon Prime Day is just weeks ahead, starting July 12 this year, but deals are already heating up. If you\\'re a Prime member, you likely already take advantage of its free two-day shipping, as well as\\xa0Amazon Prime Video and Amazon Music. But Amazon Prime includes tons of other perks and bonuses that you might not know about.\\nFor example, Amazon Prime members can get deliveries much faster than two days, sometimes in a few hours. They can also schedule delivery dates for convenience or to avoid times when they\\'ll be away from home. And they even get exclusive deals simply by\\xa0using Alexa on an Amazon Echo.\\nIf you\\'re new to Amazon Prime or don\\'t know much about all of the included features, here are some ways you can get the most out of your Amazon Prime membership while shopping on Prime Day.\\nIf there\\'s a product you want immediately, you can see if it\\'s available for delivery the same day you order. To check a product\\'s eligibility, look for delivery that\\'s marked as \"Prime FREE Same-Day\" while shopping. Note that your order will need to contain over $35 of qualifying items. If not, you\\'ll have to pay a small fee.\\nAmazon will deliver from morning until evening, so you won\\'t have to worry about receiving your order at 3 a.m. However, same-day delivery isn\\'t available in all locations, so enter your ZIP code on the\\xa0Amazon Same-Day Delivery page to see if you\\'re eligible.\\nSchedule a convenient shipping date during checkout with Amazon Day.\\nYou can use your Amazon Echo to ask \"Alexa, what are my deals?\" anytime. Alexa will then share Prime-exclusive deals and you\\'ll have the option to add the item to your cart, buy it now or move on to the next deal.\\nEveryone knows about Amazon\\'s free two-day shipping, but another option is to choose a delivery date during checkout. It\\'s called Amazon Day and it\\'s helpful if there\\'s a specific day you know someone will be at home to answer for packages -- especially if it\\'s something pricey that you don\\'t want to risk leaving unattended.\\nIf you order multiple items on different days, you can have them delivered on the same day as long as they\\'re eligible for this offer.\\nIf you have an Amazon Echo of any kind, you can use it to track your orders.\\nJust say \"Alexa, where\\'s my package?\" and your Echo will let you know where it is, who it\\'s for and when it\\'ll arrive. Once your order has been delivered, the Echo\\'s ring light will pulse yellow\\xa0and if you have the Echo Show, the delivery notification will appear on the screen.\\nUse any Amazon Echo to track your packages.\\nIf something you\\'ve been eyeing says \"Prime Early Access,\" as a Prime member you can shop that sale 30 minutes before non-Prime members. However, you\\'ll still have to compete with other Prime members who are interested in the product before it sells out.\\nWhen you know you\\'re not going to be home for a while and you\\'ve got a shipment on the way, it\\'s much safer to have an Amazon employee leave your items inside your house to avoid theft.\\nFor in-home delivery, you\\'ll need a\\xa0Key-compatible smart lock\\xa0and an (optional)\\xa0Amazon Cloud Cam. The Amazon driver will send you a notification when they\\'ve arrived at your house and will request to unlock your door. Amazon will verify the package is at the right address and the driver is near the door, then will turn on Amazon Cloud Cam and unlock your door.\\nIf you\\'re wary of\\xa0letting a complete stranger into your home, keep in mind that you\\'ll also receive notifications during the entire process. Note that you can opt to\\xa0block delivery access to your home\\xa0-- for example, if you know you\\'ll be home during that time.\\n\"Porch pirates\" -- thieves who steal packages left in front of homes -- are no joke. According to security site SafeWise, about 210 million packages were stolen from home exteriors in 2021. The\\xa0Amazon Key\\xa0in-garage delivery service can stop porch theft completely and is free for all Amazon Prime members.\\nWhen you use Amazon In-Garage Delivery, select\\xa0Key Delivery\\xa0at checkout. The\\xa0garage kit is $20 right now\\xa0and turns your garage into a smart garage. It works the same as in-home delivery so Amazon will do all the verifying for you.\\nAmazon employees can leave a package inside your house with Amazon Key.\\nAn Amazon Prime feature lets you send someone a gift, even if you don\\'t have their address. For instance, if you\\'d like to send a coworker something for the holidays or their birthday but don\\'t know what their address is, you can still send a gift. But there\\'s a catch -- that person must also have a Prime account and you need either their phone number or email address associated with the account.\\nBe aware: Not every item on Amazon is eligible.\\nIf you\\'ve got another adult living in your household, like a significant other or friend, you can share your Prime membership with them. You\\'ll still be able to keep your personal accounts separate, but you\\'ll both have access to all the same Prime benefits.\\nYou can also share your account with up to four teens and up to four children in your household. While they\\'ll have their own logins, you can still manage their profiles.\\nFor more shopping tips this year, here\\'s\\xa0how to send your Amazon packages back the fast, easy and free way.'),\n",
