            "            Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of the parents, \n",

            "            Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. \n",
            "            Rootstocks are used to control speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree allowing for easier harvesting.\n",
            "            There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. \n",
            "            Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and use, including cooking, eating raw and cider production.\n",
            "            Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, \n",

            "            In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.\n",
            "            Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of the total.\n",
